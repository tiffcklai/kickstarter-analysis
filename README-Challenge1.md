## Overview of the project 
### To observe the effect of Launch Dates and Funding Goals on the Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
To begin a proper analysis, the data was filtered to only observe kickstarter campaigns for theater productions. Based on the launch date, the corresponding outcomes (i.e. successful, failed, canceled) for the kickstarter campaigns were observed in the graph below. The month with the highest successful theater campaigns is in May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this data analysis, the goal amounts were broken down into ranges to observe the trends between the outcomes of theater kickstarter campaigns within the subcategory "plays".

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main difficulty that presented itself was verifying the integrity of the data analysis (i.e. equations, pivot tables, pivot charts, etc.). To overcome this issue, documents and graphs were saved and uploaded to GitHub to serve as a backup or audit trail of the progress of the assignment. If errors were noticed, the documents were reviewed to determine the root cause of the error and how to fix it. 

## Results
For analysis of outcomes based on launch date, May and June would be the best months to start a campaign for theater related fundraisers. The outcomes of failed campaigns does not fluctuate significantly throughout the year; however for successful campaigns, there is a clear spike in May which carries over into June. This shows a trend throughout many years of great success for campaigns launching in May and June. 

Outcomes based on campaign goals analysis did not conclude to a very clear trend. To compare with the client's play, *Fever*, with the goal of $10,000+, the percentage of successful and failed outcomes are similar within the range of $10000 - $14000. More analysis would be beneficial to observe if this trend could be explained by another trend linked to the outcome.

Limitations and Recommendations for the dataset include the following: 
* Filtering the data based on country, as *Fever* is a play that will be held in the US. Observe if this filter affects the trends described above.
* The Deadline date should also be considered with the Launch Date to observe any trends in the outcomes. This would provide a complete analysis on whether the length of a kickstarter may affect the outcome.
