# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and factors that make a campaign successful 
## Category Outcomes
**1. Parent Category**

Analysis to compare the outcomes (successful, live, failed, canceled) based on the parent catogory and subcategory of each Kickstarter was performed. From the graph provided below, it is clear that the theater category has been very successful in launching campaigns. Additionally, there are significantly more campaigns launched around the theater category when compared to other categories, proving that a Kickstarter is a good path to take for raising money. To obtain a closer look at how this data is related to plays, the subcategories were analyzed next.

**2. Subcategory** 

Next, the theater category was filtered to observe only the outcomes for the kickstarter campaigns for plays. Within the Theater category, a majority of the kickstarter campaigns are related to funding for plays specifically. In contrast with the other subcategories, musicals and spaces, plays has a noticeably higher success rate.

## Launch Date Outcomes

To determine the best month of the year to launch a fundraiser, the outcomes versus the launch dates were observed. The results indicated that May and June would be the best months to start a campaign as there was a higher ratio of successful to failed campaigns during these months.

## Future Projects

For a future project regarding plays in Great Britain, the graph below was created to visualize the distribution of campaign goals versus pledged amounts per campaign. The mean (x) is at £4000 and it is above the third quartile of the amount pledged for campaigns. This shows that a campaign should have aim for a goal lower than £4000 as this data shows the mean (x) amount pledged is lower than that.
